   data from OCaml. It addresses a few shortcomings of its predecessor
   json-wheel and is about twice as fast (2.7x reading, 1.3x writing; results
   may vary).
   The design goals of Yojson are the following:<ul><li>Reducing inter-package dependencies by the use of polymorphic
   variants for the JSON tree type.</li><li>Allowing type-aware serializers/deserializers 
   to read and write directly without going through a generic JSON tree,
   for efficiency purposes.
   Readers and writers of all JSON syntaxic elements are provided
   but are undocumented and meant to be used by generated OCaml code.</li><li>Distinguishing between ints and floats.</li><li>Providing optional extensions of the JSON syntax.
   These extensions include comments, arbitrary strings,
   optional quotes around field names, tuples and variants.</li></ul><div class="authors"><b>Author(s): </b><span class="author">Martin Jambon</span></div><div class="see"><b>See also</b> <ul>  <li> <a href="http://json.org">JSON specification</a></li></ul></div></div></td></tr>
