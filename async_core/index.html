    variable, and is analogous to OCaml's <code class="code">Condition</code> module.  The main guarantee that a
    condition variable provides is that a call to <code class="code">signal</code> (or <code class="code">broadcast</code>) after a call
    to <code class="code">wait</code> will be seen by the waiter.<br/>    Unlike the use of condition variables in ordinary threaded programs, async condition
    variables do not require a mutex, since async programs are cooperatively threaded.</div></td></tr>

<tr><td class="module"><a href="?package=async_core&amp;module=Async_or_error">Async_or_error</a></td><td><div class="info">This module is the deferred analog of <code class="code">Core.Or_error</code>. It is exposed in std.ml as
    <code class="code">Deferred.Or_error</code>.<br/>    The mental model for a function returning an <code class="code">'a Deferred.Or_error.t</code> is that the
    function never raises.  All error cases are caught and expressed as an <code class="code">Error _</code>
    result.  This module preserves that property.<br/>    Unfortunately, there is no way to enforce this property using the type system, so it
    is more like a convention, or idiom.  A function whose type ends with <code class="code">... -&gt; 'a
    Deferred.Or_error.t</code> and still raises should be considered broken, and be fixed.  With
    that property in mind, <code class="code">Deferred.Or_error.List.iter</code>, for example, does not wrap the
    execution of the given iter function <code class="code">f</code> inside a monitor.  If one of these
    application raises, the whole function <code class="code">Deferred.Or_error.List.iter</code> will raise as a
    way to try to alert the developer that one the function is broken and needs attention
    and fixing, rather than silently catching the error and converting it to
    <code class="code">Or_error.Error</code>.<br/>    This behavior is consistent with <code class="code">Core.Or_error</code>'s treatment of user-supplied
    functions.<br/>    If you have to deal with a function that does not respect this idiom, you can use
    <code class="code">Deferred.Or_error.try_with_join</code> to wrap its execution and enforce this property.</div></td></tr>

    Stream.next, which (asynchronously) returns the element and the rest of the stream.</div></td></tr>

    in (i.e. backpatch it).  This is useful when there is a cycle in the definitions of
    some entities, but the cycle can be resolved (by backpatching) before the value in
    the hole needs to be accessed dynamically.</div></td></tr>

    alive, given that a monitor has a pointer to its parent, but not its children.  So,
    there is no way when killing a monitor to visit all of its descendants.  Instead, we
    rely on lazily checking descendants when they are used.<br/>    Each monitor has a <code class="code">kill_index : Kill_index.t</code>, and the scheduler has a single
    <code class="code">global_kill_index : Kill_index.t</code>.  We maintain an invariant on the monitor tree that
    if a monitor's kill index equals <code class="code">global_kill_index</code>, then all of its ancestors kill
    indices also equal <code class="code">global_kill_index</code>.  This ensures that any monitor whose kill
    index equals <code class="code">global_kill_index</code> is alive.<br/>    All kill indices initially start with value <code class="code">Kill_index.initial</code>.  To kill a monitor,
    we set that monitor's kill index to <code class="code">Kill_index.dead</code> and increment the scheduler's
    <code class="code">global_kill_index</code>.  A monitor can be in one of three situations:<br/>    - <code class="code">kill_index = global_kill_index</code>.  The monitor is alive.<ul><li><code class="code">kill_index = dead</code>.  The monitor is dead.  A dead monitor is never revived.</li><li>Otherwise, some monitor has been killed since the monitor was last known to be
      alive.  We must check the monitor's ancestors to see if an ancestor is dead.  If so,
      we will set its <code class="code">kill_index</code> to <code class="code">dead</code>.  If not, we will set its <code class="code">kill_index</code> to
      <code class="code">global_kill_index</code>.

<tr><td class="module"><a href="?package=async_core&amp;module=Lazy_deferred">Lazy_deferred</a></td><td><div class="info">A <code class="code">Lazy_deferred.t</code> is a delayed computation that can produce a deferred.  Nothing
    happens with a lazy deferred unless one <code class="code">force</code>s it.  Forcing a lazy deferred starts
    the computation, which will eventually cause the deferred to become determined.  As
    usual with laziness, multiply forcing a lazy deferred is no different than forcing it
    a single time.<br/>    Exceptions (both synchronous and asynchronous) raised by a delayed computation are
    returned by <code class="code">force</code> (<code class="code">wait</code>, <code class="code">peek</code>, etc.), or will be raised to the monitor in effect
    when <code class="code">force_exn</code> (<code class="code">wait_exn</code>, <code class="code">peek_exn</code>, etc.) was called.</div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="module"><a href="?package=async_core&amp;module=Monitor">Monitor</a></td><td><div class="info">A monitor is a context that determines what to do when there is an unhandled
    exception.  Every Async computation runs within the context of some monitor, which,
    when the computation is running, is referred to as the &quot;current&quot; monitor.  Monitors
    are arranged in a tree -- when a new monitor is created, it is a child of the current
    monitor.<br/>    One can listen to a monitor using Monitor.errors to learn when the monitor sees an
    error.<br/>    If a computation raises an unhandled exception, the current monitor does one of two
    things.  If anyone is listening to the monitor (i.e. Monitor.errors has been called on
    the monitor), then the error stream is extended, and the listeners are responsible for
    doing something.  If no one is &quot;listening&quot; to the monitor, then the exception is
    raised to monitor's parent.  The initial monitor, i.e. the root of the monitor tree,
    prints an unhandled-exception message and calls exit 1.<br/>*************** NOTE ABOUT THE TOPLEVEL MONITOR ****************<br/>    It is important to note that in the toplevel monitor, exceptions will only be caught
    in the async part of a computation.  For example, in:<br/>    <pre class="codepre"><code class="code">
      upon (f ()) g
    </code></pre><br/>    if <code class="code">f</code> raises, the exception will not go to a monitor; it will go to the next caml
    exception handler on the stack.  Any exceptions raised by <code class="code">g</code> will be caught by the
    scheduler and propagated to the toplevel monitor.  Because of this it is advised to
    always use <code class="code">Scheduler.schedule</code> or <code class="code">Scheduler.within</code>.  For example:<br/>    <pre class="codepre"><code class="code">
      Scheduler.within (fun () -&gt; upon (f ()) g)
    </code></pre><br/>    This code will catch an exception in either <code class="code">f</code> or <code class="code">g</code>, and propagate it to the
    monitor.<br/>    This is only relevant to the toplevel monitor because if you create another monitor
    and you wish to run code within it you have no choice but to use <code class="code">Scheduler.within</code>.
    <code class="code">try_with</code> creates its own monitor and uses <code class="code">Scheduler.within</code>, so it does not have
    this problem.</div></td></tr>
<tr><td class="module"><a href="?package=async_core&amp;module=Pipe">Pipe</a></td><td><div class="info">A pipe is a buffered FIFO communication channel.<br/>    A pipe has a &quot;writer&quot; end and a &quot;reader&quot; end.  The intent is that a writer feeds
    values into the pipe and then waits until it is notified that it should put more data
    in (referred to as &quot;pushback&quot;).<br/>    Each pipe contains a buffer that is a queue of values that have been written to the
    pipe but not yet read from the pipe.  The length of the queue is not bounded; whenever
    the pipe is written to, values are immediately enqueued.  However, writers are
    supposed to respect pushback from readers, either via the <code class="code">unit Deferred.t</code> returned
    by <code class="code">write</code> calls or by explicitly calling <code class="code">pushback</code>.<br/>    If a pipe is empty, then readers queue up, waiting for values to be written.  As soon
    as values are written, if a reader is available to consume them, the values will be
    handed to the reader.<br/>    One can use <code class="code">downstream_flushed</code> to get notified by a pipe when all prior writes have
    been consumed by a reader.<br/>    There are distinct <code class="code">Reader</code> and <code class="code">Writer</code> modules and types, but all of the operations
